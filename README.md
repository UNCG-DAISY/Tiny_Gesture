## Introduction

Machine Learning on Microcontrollers is the most efficient, cheap, and reliable way of developing Edge Computing applications with low energy consumption. ‘Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board’ is used as a microcontroller to capture and classify 5 human gestures - “Squat”, “Jump”, “Walk”, “Run”, “Other”. Built Deep Learning model using captured gestures data to classify human gestures.
